// Generate and copy URL
const handleGenerateDeleteUrl = () => {
  DeleteAccountUrlService.copyDeleteAccountUrl(user.uid, user.email);
};

// Open email client
const handleEmailDeleteRequest = () => {
  DeleteAccountUrlService.openEmailRequest(user.uid, user.email);
};

// Get shareable message
const handleShareDeleteRequest = () => {
  const message = DeleteAccountUrlService.generateShareableMessage(user.uid, user.email);
  // Show or share the message
};
```

### Deep Link Handling
```typescript
// In App.tsx or main navigation
import { DeleteAccountUrlService } from './src/utils/deleteAccountUrl';

const handleDeepLink = (url: string) => {
  const deleteRequest = DeleteAccountUrlService.parseDeleteAccountLink(url);
  
  if (deleteRequest && DeleteAccountUrlService.isRequestValid(deleteRequest.timestamp)) {
    // Show in-app deletion confirmation
    showDeleteConfirmation(deleteRequest);
  }
};
```

   - User goes to Settings ‚Üí Data & Privacy
   - Selects preferred method (URL, Email, Share)
   - Receives deletion link/message

   - System validates request parameters

   - System processes the request
   - Account and data are permanently deleted

4. **Completion**:

# Profile Validation System

This document explains the profile validation system implemented in CreatorCircle to ensure users have complete profiles before performing certain actions.

## Overview

The profile validation system prevents users from:
- Sending collaboration requests
- Creating posts
- Commenting on posts

Until they have completed their profile with all required information.

## Required Profile Fields

For a profile to be considered complete, users must have:

1. **Name** - User's display name
2. **College** - Educational institution
3. **Profile Picture** - Profile photo URL
4. **Skills** - At least one skill (array)
5. **Interests** - At least one interest (array)

## Components

### ProfileValidationService

Located at `src/services/profileValidationService.ts`

#### Key Methods:

- `validateProfileCompletion(profile)` - Returns completion status
- `canPerformAction(profile, actionName)` - Checks if user can perform specific action
- `getProfileCompletionMessage(status)` - Returns user-friendly message

#### Usage Example:

```typescript
import { ProfileValidationService } from '../services/profileValidationService';

const profileCheck = ProfileValidationService.canPerformAction(userProfile, 'create_post');
if (!profileCheck.allowed) {
  Alert.alert('Profile Incomplete', profileCheck.message);
  return;
}
```

### ProfileCompletionPrompt Component

Located at `src/components/ProfileCompletionPrompt.tsx`

A reusable modal component that shows:
- Completion percentage
- Progress bar
- Missing fields list
- Action buttons

### Profile Completion Banner

Integrated into the main ProfileScreen (`src/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx`) to show:
- Completion status
- Progress indicator
- Encouragement to complete profile

## Implementation Details

### Where Validation is Applied

1. **FindPeopleScreen** - Before sending collaboration requests
2. **UserProfileScreen** - Before sending collaboration requests
3. **PostCreationModal** - Before creating posts
4. **PostCard** - Before commenting on posts

### User Experience Flow

1. User attempts restricted action
2. System checks profile completion
3. If incomplete:
   - Shows alert with missing fields
   - Offers "Complete Profile" button
   - Redirects to profile screen
4. If complete:
   - Allows action to proceed

### Completion Calculation

Completion percentage is calculated as:
```
(completed_fields / total_required_fields) * 100
```

Where total required fields = 5 (name, college, profile picture, skills, interests)

## Benefits

- **Quality Control** - Ensures meaningful user interactions
- **User Engagement** - Encourages profile completion
- **Better Matching** - Complete profiles enable better collaboration matching
- **Professional Appearance** - Maintains platform quality standards

## Future Enhancements

- Add more granular validation rules
- Implement progressive profile completion
- Add profile strength indicators
- Create guided profile setup wizard
- Add profile completion rewards/gamification
